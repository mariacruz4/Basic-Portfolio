    Hello! My name is Maria Cruz and today I will be telling you a little bit about myself. Where to start? ðŸ¤” Well, I was born and raised in Dallas, Texas and I am the middle child of six siblings. Yes, you read that right, six. Although I have lived in America my whole life, the majority of my family is from Honduras. Growing up, my parents would educate me about the Honduran culture, so it never felt like I was lost whenever I went to visit Honduras. </p>
    <p>Fun fact! I recently graduated from the University of Texas at Dallas with my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and Systems. Academics has always been one of my top priorities, so I was extremely happy when I recieved my degree. But enough about me, let's check out some of my projects!</p>
